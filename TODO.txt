//DONE: add bucket effects when hit by spike
//DONE: add effect for catching an egg
//DONE: Add "level #" to HUD
//DONE: add jar bounce combo mechanic
//DONE: Refactor -
//// fix variable prefixes
//// rename and refactor config and result variables
//// make naming more consistent
//DONE: add max combo multiplier (13)
//DONE: move this backlog
//DONE: make life into hearts
//DONE: rearrange HUD, place elements in bottom
//DONE: add jar ability - grows bigger after jam gets to top
//DONE: update Start menu layout, make game name have transparent background (only start, quit buttons have panel)
//DONE: Do Emscriptem build
//DONE: Look into packaging for different platforms

//WIP: add more levels, and test for balance
//WIP: iterate until it's fun
//TODO: [design] make bananas one of the harder fruits? x
//TODO: [design] increase pear difficulty rating x
//TODO: [design] introduce spikes earlier x
//TODO: [design] subtract density from level 4, make it easier, make level 6 easier (less density, separate banana from coconut) x
//TODO: [design] review score numbers and multiplers (should it be x10 or x100, how big does score get until end?)]
//DONE: [bug] Fix HideCursor bug - Raylib ticket - https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/4940
//DONE: [bug] EM build does not load levels correctly
//DONE: [bug] orange shows up in level 4???
//DONE: fix bugs

//NEXT: add effect for filling jam to the top 
//TODO: make jar growth on mouse click
//TODO: tighten the collision between big and small jar to magnify effect and make growing the jar easier
//TODO: update big jar art to something better
//TODO: add ending celebration music and sound effect
//NEXT: Add bg elements to show max vertical movement (i.e. a vineyard with wooden frames, and one of the wood planks extends horizontally where max Y is)

//--dev complete--
//TODO: Update Readme
//TODO: Look into adding this to itch.io

EXPLORE:
//TODO: add emscripten functions to handle quitting game so it doesn't freeze when hitting quit (or handle quit for web)
//TODO: game mode where you pause to first move the jar in anticipation of where fruit will fall. (play the game with hidecursor bug and try to move jar by pausing). Could be game mode, i.e. turn based mode catch.

THOUGHTS:
// there could be powerup for big jar (instead of collecting fruits?)
